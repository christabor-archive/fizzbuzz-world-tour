## FizzBuzz - World Tour!

#### Why would I do this?
------------------------------------

* I'm a little off my rocker
* I wanted to learn some basics of various languages and expand my understanding, by using a common, simple program. The functional languages, in particular, taught me some interesting things.
* If a future employer wanted to ask me for a fizzbuzz test (laughable), I could just point them to this, and say "Hey, I've done it in over N languages!"
* I know what you're saying... "COBOL -- Really?" Yeah. I know.
* Why not!
* P.S. Brainf*ck loops are **evil**

#### List of languages currently completed:
------------------------------------

* Python
* Perl
* JavaScript
* Ruby
* Go
* Lua
* Scala
* Rust
* Bash
* Java
* CofeeScript
* R

#### Running/testing
------------------------------------

I've tried to write files with the conventions of that particular language in mind, as best as I could find quickly and easily.

I've kept it very simple: to run, I use standard bash commands, and pipe the results to a file to run a diff and thus compare results. In many cases, you will need to install an interpreter to run each file.

(e.g. node fizzbuzz.js >> js-test.txt)

(note: a couple files, notably R, output the contents of the file, as well as any stdout statements. I couldn't find a way to prevent that, though I am guessing it is some kind of flag when running the file via command line.)

Some languages require compilation. You'll need to install the correct compiler in that case. For example, I use brew install [compiler-name] for all the languages that require it.

...need to test they are actually correct, but the results are at least matching.

#### Unfinished
